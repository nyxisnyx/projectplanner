# Project planner
This is a project planner which allows you to organise your to-do list.

## Features
- Done entirely in HTML, CSS (SASS) and Javascript
- Add new tasks, assign them a deadline and watch as the web app tells you how many days you have left to complete it
- Tag your tasks with a status then filter the list to show, for instance, all the tasks you haven't started yet
- Fully responsive
- Dark mode
