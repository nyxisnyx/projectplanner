### The Mission

Wouldn't it be nice to have a tool to manage our projects? Something that would allow us to track the progression of each requirement of our apps.

Here's the list of features we would like to see:

- **Allow users to create tasks**: Tasks should have a name, a description, and a due date.

- **Allow users to label their tasks with a status** (e.g., to do, doing, done).

- **Display tasks, along with their remaining time**: For example, if today is the 15th of March and the task is due by the 20th of March, display "in 5 days."

- **Allow users to sort their tasks by remaining time**, with the most urgent first, or by name.

- **Filter tasks** (e.g., only show "to do" tasks).

- **BONUS**: Save tasks in LocalStorage so that they persist even when the page is refreshed.

### Requirements

- Use JS Modules.
- Implement Dark Mode.
- Ensure Responsiveness.
- Utilize SASS.
